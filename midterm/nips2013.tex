% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this report, we list the results we've achieved for classifying the subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use the K-nearest neighbours and SVM to achieve an accuracy of X\% and Y\% respectively.\\

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include 
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the 
final paper. 

\subsubsection*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered third level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to `small' (9-point) 
when listing the references. {\bf Remember that this year you can use
a ninth page as long as it contains \emph{only} cited references.}
